Enhancement Suggestions:


jmario suggests round robin thread pinning to CPUs: I have a "-R" flag for
round_robin_threads in /shak/bgray/pig_tool/pig_joe.c. It pins each thread to a
given CPU in a round-robin fashion across the box (thread 0 gets bound to cpu
0, thread 1 gets bound to cpu 1,...) It may be useful to merge that into the
main pig.c at some point.


pportant suggests: Have you considered adding a load pattern combination? E.g.
percent spin, sleep, int, fpu, mem, and/or dirty for a given time interval? The
upstream "ssbench" tool does something similar for swift workloads, and you
seem to almost have this with a combination of -l and -i options.  See the
readme on Scenarios at https://github.com/swiftstack/ssbench Perhaps it would
be useful to describe workloads that come close to mimicking known application
behavior patterns? E.g. kvm VM startup, httpd, etc.  If you consider scenario
files above, then we could encode these in scenario files to share common usage
patterns.
